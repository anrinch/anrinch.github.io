# CS 588: Security and Privacy in Networked and Distributed Systems



## Course Description

This course will cover foundational concepts and advanced topics in privacy-enhancing technologies for connected and distributed systems. The content will focus on techniques for confidential communication, integrity, anonymity and reliability in networked systems. Additionally, the course will discuss challenges that arise in distributed setups with adversarial parties. Along the way, the material will introduce the necessary background in cryptography and show how cryptographic tools are used in real systems to provide the aforementioned guarantees. 

The class is intended for graduate students who are interested in learning about the security and privacy challenges of modern (large-scale) systems. Class meetings will typically include regular instructions and discussions of offline reading resources. The content will cover material from textbooks and academic papers. Students are expected to complete a semester-long project, and present their work in class. Prior experience in security or privacy is not required but will be beneficial in better understanding the material.

​                                                                                                          

### Grading

* **Warm-up assignment (5%)**

- **Semester-Long Project (70%):** The most important component of your grade. You will engage in a group project (maximum of 2 people). You will deliver a short report and present your work to the class towards the end of the semester. The project topics will be available in the first few weeks, or can be selected by the students. The 

- **Reading Responses (20%):** There will be reading assignments (academic papers) after every topic we cover. At the start of class there will be a short quiz asking you simple comprehension style questions about readings from the previous week. 

- **Class Participation (5%):** A small part of your grade comes from participation. Participation can be earned in several ways: i) being active on Piazza, i.e., answering and commenting on questions, ii) actively engaging in discussion and asking questions in class.
