# CS 588: Security and Privacy in Networked and Distributed Systems



## Course Description

This course will cover foundational concepts and advanced topics in privacy-enhancing technologies for connected and distributed systems. The content will focus on techniques for confidential communication, integrity, anonymity and reliability in networked systems. Additionally, the course will discuss challenges that arise in distributed setups with adversarial parties. Along the way, the material will introduce the necessary background in cryptography and show how cryptographic tools are used in real systems to provide the aforementioned guarantees. 

The class is intended for graduate students who are interested in learning about the security and privacy challenges of modern (large-scale) systems. Class meetings will typically include regular instructions and discussions of offline reading resources. The content will cover material from textbooks and academic papers. Students are expected to complete a semester-long project, and present their work in class. Prior experience in security or privacy is not required but will be beneficial in better understanding the material.
