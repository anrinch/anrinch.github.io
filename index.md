## About Me

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://cs.uic.edu). I build systems that incorporate cryptographic protocols to solve real-world problems. My research lies in the intersection of cryptography, systems and theory. 
As part of my research I build secure databases and cloud computing technologies, end-to-end encrypted messaging applications, and cryptographic tools for autonomous vehicle communication. 

My current research involves answering the following questions (among other things)

- [How do we make smart vehicle technologies more robust against adversarial interference?](/research/)
- [How do we make secure messaging services truly private and censorship-resilient?](/research/)
- [How do we design efficient cryptographic tools for statistical frameworks?](/research/)

I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Computer Science at [Duke University](https://cs.duke.edu) working with [Prof. Michael Reiter](https://reitermk.github.io/). I obtained my PhD from [Stony Brook University](https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu) where I was advised by [Prof. Radu Sion](https://zxr.io/). Even before that I obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from [Jadavpur University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadavpur_University), India
