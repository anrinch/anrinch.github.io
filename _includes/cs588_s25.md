## Test

In this course we explore how societal issues of ethics, fairness, responsibility, and privacy affect the data science lifecycle. The data science lifecycle includes data acquisition, cleaning and pre-processing, analysis and use of data (we explore techniques from machine learning, inferential statistics, and causal inference), and communication of data science results. We will consider what additional decisions we must make when data is about individuals and privacy matters. And we will think about data flows, their effect on the modern economy, and the interactions with the topics of the course. We will consider the steps one must follow to conduct data science tasks responsibly, and will delve into the details of fairness and privacy issues that arise along the way. The course has four components: lectures, programming assignments, readings, and a quarter-long project. 
Through the combination of these four, students who complete the course will learn how to conduct data science tasks responsibly, recognize fairness, privacy, and other important implications, and improve their programming and technical skillset, in addition to developing specific expertise in one of the quarter-long topics. In addition, students will be familiar with the evolving challenges of an increasingly data-driven world, and be capable of asking questions, and offering answers, to these pressing issues.
